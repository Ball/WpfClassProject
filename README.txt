Wpf Class Project
========================================================

This project is meant to be used as a starting point for the students of my Wpf Class.
Each week, I'll update this project with new helper classes, data, and the week's assignmnet.
This project will not contain a complete application.

Architecture choices are made for educational reasons.

Week 1
---------------------------------------------------------
Students are expected to "draw" a picture of their own design with xaml.
This week's goal is to explore Xaml and basic graphical primitives.

Week 2
---------------------------------------------------------
Start of Wpf Tunes: a Wpf based iTunes clone with actual, but limited, functionality.
This week's goal is to explore basic controls and layout types.
The assignment is to replicate the layout of WpfTunes as pictured in the file

Week 3
---------------------------------------------------------
Will it Blend?
This week's goal is to bind the UI elements to a back-end data structure.
If you've used blend before, I recommend trying it with a xaml initialized data context.
Set an instance of ShellDesignData to the Shell's DataContext and bind to get WPF to match

Week 4
---------------------------------------------------------
With Style and Grace
This week's goal is to make the application look good!
* Give the play/pause/stop button the appropriate symbols
  (we'll use triggers and visible layers)
* The next and previous buttons need to look correct
* Buttons need a "pressed" and "mouseover"
* The main frame needs to have a subtle gradient
* The Playlist needs to be BLUE
