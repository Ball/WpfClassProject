Wpf Class Project
========================================================

This project is meant to be used as a starting point for the students of my Wpf Class.
Each week, I'll update this project with new helper classes, data, and the week's assignmnet.
This project will not contain a complete application.

Architecture choices are made for educational reasons.

Week 1
---------------------------------------------------------
Students are expected to "draw" a picture of their own design with xaml.
This week's goal is to explore Xaml and basic graphical primitives.

Week 2
---------------------------------------------------------
Start of Wpf Tunes: a Wpf based iTunes clone with actual, but limited, functionality.
This week's goal is to explore basic controls and layout types.
The assignment is to replicate the layout of WpfTunes as pictured in the file
